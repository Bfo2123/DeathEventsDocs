# FAQ

Q: What is the ParticleCount thing?

A: That is the feature that allows you to change the amount of particles that show up when a user dies. I would recommend having 50 or lower particles if your server has less resources.



Q: Can I suggest features for this plugin?

A: Yeah! Simply just leave a 5 star review on the spigot page, or join our Discord and let me know!



Q: How do I give users the permissions for the plugin?

A: To do that simply, just install a permissions plugin onto your server for example LuckPerms and you can give them the permission there, but the plugin you choose to use is up to you.

  
Q: Why do you have a reload command if it automatically reloads

A: Just for the convivence if you change anything manually in the config.yml file.
